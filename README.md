# Video-Player-App-with-Play-Forward-and-Rewind-Control
A video player application with ‘Play’, ‘Forward’ , ‘Rewind’ functionalities and fetching data by mvvm pattern.

I have to used VideoView for play video and also used default mediacontroller for play/pause, forward and rewind but i can be able to make custom controller for play/puase, forward and rewind.Also, I have used stream url as media feed.
